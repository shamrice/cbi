# CBI - COBOL BASIC Interpreter 
CBI is a BASIC Interpreter written in GnuCOBOL. In its current state, it is just a proof of concept. I can't imagine a "real world" purpose for this beyond being something I'm having fun creating. The BASIC syntax supported by this application is based off of Microsoft's QBasic.

The current list of implemented (most likely not fully) commands can be found in the [BASIC Keywords Copybook](https://github.com/shamrice/cbi/blob/main/source/copybooks/basic_keywords.cpy)

To build, simply run the ```build.sh``` build script. This will create a ```cbi``` executable that you can test run some BASIC source code against.

This readme will mostly likely be updated with more detailed information as things progress.
